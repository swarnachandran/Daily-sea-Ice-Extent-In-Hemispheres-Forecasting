Overview
Climate change is a widely discussed topic, impacting various aspects of our environment. One significant indicator of climate change is the extent of sea ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Monitoring and forecasting the extent of sea ice is crucial for understanding the broader impacts of climate change on our ecosystems and human activities.

Project Scope

This project aims to:

-> Perform time series analysis to determine the hemisphere exhibiting a greater extent of sea ice.
-> Develop predictive models for future sea ice extent using historical data.
-> Create a web application to visualize the performance metrics of each forecasting model.

Methodology

Data Collection:

  The dataset is sourced from the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and includes daily sea ice extent measurements from 1978 to 2023.
  
Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure no missing values and proper format for time series analysis.

Modeling:

Various forecasting models such as Holt-Winters, ARMA, SARIMA, and Multi-Linear Regression are applied to predict the sea ice extent.

The SARIMA model was found to perform the best among all models.

Results

The SARIMA model accurately forecasted the sea ice extent, capturing both seasonal and trend components effectively. This model is crucial for predicting future changes in sea ice extent, aiding in climate policy formulation and resource management.

Conclusion
Reliable forecasting of sea ice extent is essential for understanding the impacts of climate change. This project provides valuable insights and a robust framework for predicting sea ice extent, contributing significantly to climate change research.
